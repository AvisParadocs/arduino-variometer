Hi! I have a few questions about code and logic behind it. Could you help me  to understand. At the moment I on prototype stage, so its impossible to test vario in real conditions.

1. What info is shown on alternate screen which calls by (VARIOMETER_ALTERNATE_PAGE_DURATION)? On my screen it shows weird numbers which don't look like coordinates or time.

2. What logic is behind the VARIOMETER_NEAR_CLIMBING_SENSITIVITY and VARIOMETER_ENABLE_NEAR_CLIMBING_BEEP parameters? Ive tested them  and didn't noticed any changes.

3. Correct me if I didn't understand the correct way to setup a firmware. First I upload a variometer.ino then accel_calibration.ino and performing calibration through serial monitor.
(I've checked VarioSettings.h, set there #define IMU_CALIBRATION_IN_EEPROM and commented #define IMU_GYRO_CAL_BIAS and etc.) If I upload SetVarioParameters.ino on any stage, device didn't respond at all.
